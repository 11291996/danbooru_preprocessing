Both are depicted with animal_ears, specifically rabbit_ears, and each has a rabbit_tail. The girl with black_hair is in the background, holding a bottle and appearing to have played a prank on the sleeping blonde_haired girl by removing her clothes, resulting in clothes_theft. The blonde_haired girl is barefoot and has no_pants, her japanese_clothes loosely draped over her, revealing her ass and fundoshi. Both characters display fang, tail and hair_ornaments like hair_bow and bow, typical of bishamonten's_pagoda themed illustrations. The scene conveys a sense of yukkuri_shiteitte_ne, a playful, relaxed mood despite the theft and prank.\",\n  \"RATING\": \"QUESTIONABLE\",\n  \"ADDITIONAL_TAGS\": \"exposed buttocks, sleeping position, alcohol bottle, implied nudity, socks\"\n}\n```"
