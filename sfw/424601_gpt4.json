Greyscale is used to illustrate the scenes without color. Fangs are visible, suggesting an aggressive or comical depiction. There is a panel showing implied_pantyshot, as well as blood represented in the form of a nosebleed, which is a common trope in manga for humor or embarrassment. Finally, a wrench is included as part of the narrative.\",\n  \"RATING\" : \"QUESTIONABLE\",\n  \"ADDITIONAL_TAGS\" : \"humor, manga_tropes\"\n}\n```"
