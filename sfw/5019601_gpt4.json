She wears a pink shirt with short sleeves, white pants, and a hair ornament consisting of a simple hairclip. Her closed mouth and blush suggest a moment of shyness or concentration, as she looks directly at the viewer. A plectrum is attached to the guitar's head. Clothes with writing are visible, and a paper with musical notes is on the floor. A school bag is peeking out from behind her, suggesting an after-school activity. A second girl is seen in the background, also with a school bag, peeking out through an open door, which adds to the tag multiple girls.\",\n  \"RATING\": \"SAFE\",\n  \"ADDITIONAL_TAGS\": \"music practice, indoor setting, after-school activity\"\n}\n```"
