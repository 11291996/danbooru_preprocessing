Each girl exhibits unique features like animal_ears, rabbit_ears, fox_tail, and multiple_tails. They are adorned in distinct clothing that includes a dress, shirt, sailor_collar, sailor_hat, shorts, and shoes. Accessories like a neckerchief, hat characterised with an anchor_symbol, and a mob cap contribute to their individual looks. They appear to be engaging in an eating activity, one holding dango and being in the act of holding_food with her hand_up, while the other is holding a ladle or hishaku. The wide_sleeves and hands_in_opposite_sleeves of their garments, along with one character's hair_over_one_eye, add to their traditional appearance. The artist has included his signature as artist_name, and there's an element of traditional_media in the artwork. A simple_background supports the central focus on the characters. The tabard and animal_hat, along with a specific wagashi, are included in the image. There's an ofuda present as well, although its significance in the drawing is not mentioned among the given tags.\",\n  \"RATING\": \"SAFE\",\n  \"ADDITIONAL_TAGS\": \"artist_signature, traditional_artwork\"\n}\n```"
